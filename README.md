# Travel Japan
​
https://mikemarien.github.io/travelJapan/ 
​
This project was designed to give user's a look into traveling to Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. The website features a curated list of relatively less-traveled cities in Japan. The user initially interacts with the locations on a large map of Japan where there are pins that represent each city. The the user is able to click on the marker, rendering a satellite view of that particular city, and then the user is able to double click on the marker, rendering an embedded map with a landmark, a list of restaurants, a safety warning based on user_ratings_total and the current weather for said city.
​
This project utilized:
- Google Maps API: the large map featuring all of the pins
- Google Places API: the "safety warning" based on user_ratings_total for a specific location
- Weather API: the current weather for each city
​
* Important note: the user will need to have the Google Chrome CORS extension in order to fully utilize this website
