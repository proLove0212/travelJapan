          <h8>-Hayato Takahashi, founder & CEO
            (fictional character)</h8>
          <p class="left-align light">Travel Japan was founded in 1995 by former diving instructor Takahashi Hayato. Takahashi noticed that a large portion of his customers were from outside of Japan, and decided to capitalize on the opportunity. Takahashi has since expanded his small diving studio into medium-sized business, with his son and daughter employed at the company. 


          Takahashi wishes a safe return for tourists when the time is right, in the midst of the current pandemic.
